# Image_Classifier
 
This is a image Boolean classifier to define the occurrence of plumes, escaping cells, and necrotic core. The images could be generated by the simulator hosted in https://github.com/PhysiCell-Models/breastcancer-hypoxia, or by cloud-hosted interactive model at https://nanohub.org/tools/pc4tumorhypoxia.

You can run `Tools.py`, according to the code below,  to classify all images from folders.

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Example of image Boolean classifier (b=0.5, F_r = 50%, and T_p = 50h) 
    print(ImageOpenCV("snapshots/Output_B05_F050_T050.jpg"))

    # Analysis of 20 replicates for b=0.5, F_r = 50%, and T_p = 50h (Folder \replicas)
    ReplicaAnalysis()

    # Classifying all simulations from folder \snapshots
    Classify_all_simulations()
```
